# Tabback Chrome Extension âš¡ðŸ—˜âš¡

Hello there, if you have many tabs open like me, and you sometimes get frustrated finding the last opened tab. This extension will help you.

It is a simple light weight plugin that brings you back to the previously viewed tab. This can give you a back and forth utility if you for example need to go back and forth between tabs.

I will post a link to the official chrome extension in a little while.
